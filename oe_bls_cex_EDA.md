*Consumer Unit*

*Weights*
In its survey design, the BLS applies stratified sampling to ensure each consumer category (geography, race, age, income, etc.) is sufficiently represented. In this method, each CU included in the CE sample represents a given number of CUs in the U.S. population

### Overview
---

The Consumer Expenditure Survey represents national estimates based upon two original
data collections: a Quarterly Interview Survey (*Interview*) and a Diary Survey (*Diary*).
Ensuring confidentiality prohibits publication of all, identifiable data inputs.
However, the BLS shares a sizeable sample of these sources, anonymized, called Public 
Use Microdata (PUMD).

The Interview data has quarterly observations on each CU, while the Diary data is 
collected online bi-weekly.  So the PUMD datasets include a NEWID key that is the CU
identifier (CUID) suffixed by the observation. For interview data, the last digit 
ranges quarters (1,2,3,4) and for diary entries ranges biweek (1,2).

The PUMD includes a dimension of population density. First, CUs are split into Urban
vs Outside Urban. Urban CUs are then split into includes a categorical variable called
**popsize** or "Population Size Area" (PSA) which yields:
- Outside urban area
- All urban consumer units
- Less than 100,000
- 100,000 to 249,999
- 250,000 to 999,999
- 1,000,000 to 2,499,999
- 2,500,000 to 4,999,999
- 5,000,000 and more

The PUMD is published as sets of SAS, STAT or csv files.
This processing uses the csv file format.

The lowest level of detail collected in the PUMD is assigned a Universal
Classification Code (UCC), a six digit string left padded with zeros. The
BLS also uses these categories of spending for its Consumer Price Inflation (CPI)
publication.

For the PUMD, the UCC details are aggregated in to tree of subtotalling variables,
in a stucture called the hierarchical grouping (HG). The HG has three forms for the 
Interview, Diary and 'Integrated' view of the PUMD data. The lowest level nodes on the
HG are UCCs themselves. For example, the UCCs for cookies ('020510') and crackers 
('20610') are subtotaled to the variable "CRAKCOOK". 

At the highest level, the HG sums into four sections:
- Consumer unit characteristics like number of people, age of the reference person
- Demographics like race, ethnicity, education
- Incomes and Taxes
- Spending (finally) also called Average Annual Expenditures
This last, largest group of variables has its first level of detail such as Food,
Housing, Transportation and Health care.

The PUMD data is distributed by year, in quarterly files that have one of these formats:
  Diary Files
    FMLD - characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures for the CU.
    MEMD - characteristics and income for each member in the CU.
    EXPD - a detailed weekly expenditure file categorized by UCC.
    DTBD - a detailed annual income file categorized by UCC.
    DTID - a Consumer Unit imputed income file categorized by UCC.
  Interview Files
    FMLI - characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures for the CU.
    MEMI - characteristics and income for each member in the CU.
    MTBI - a detailed monthly expenditure file categorized by UCC.
    ITBI - a Consumer Unit monthly income file categorized by UCC.
    ITII - a Consumer Unit monthly imputed income file categorized by UCC.4
    NTAXI - a file with federal and state tax information for each tax unit in the CU.5

While these are many, the BLS shares some programming that focuses on just four. The
'family' data are keyed by Consumer Unit (CU) from each of the interview and diary sets
(FMLI & FMLD).  The UCC level spending details are found in (EXPD & MTBI)

The Survey intends to estimate the national population so summing across CUs should
reflects *weighting* where each CU represents a different fraction of the total pop. 

(to complicate things) 
Rather than one weight for each CU, the Survey uses Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR),
where the weight is re-estimated 45 times. The column named "FINLWTyy" is the final weight
for that yy year across weighting attempts (WTREP1-44).  Then, each attempt to estimate
population (REPWT) and cost (RCOST) and cost/pop and c/p per UCC has to reflect the 45
original weighting attempts.

    pumdfiles: a dictionary, by year, with the file based dataframes
    hg: the Hierarchical Grouping table with linenum, level, title, survey, factor.
    vardict: provides a dictionary of the variables (not UCCs) in the PUMD
    codedict: provides a table with a description for each coded value in the PUMD
    
    The processing logic replicates what the BLS' own SAS (& R) program does!

### Hierarchical Grouping (HG)

The CEX Survey prompts participants to report spending on detailed variables (UCCs).
These are then subtotaled up to intermediate summary variables (FOOD, eg) and
ultimately to TOTEXP.

Hierarchical Group refers to this summary tree where the leaves are UCCs and the 
nodes are variable names. The BLS offers three alternative views of this summary:
"Diary", "Interview" and "Integrated".  

The Hierarchical Grouping is downloaded as a single zip file that unzips into folder
of fixed column width text files, for each year and each alternative summary. For
example, the file named CE-HG-Diary-2020 provides the 2020 version of Diary groupings.

Each file includes 7 columns:

    "linenum":int   is all 1s except when the title text needs to wrap. Its a 2 when the row
                    provides extra title text to be appended to the 1 row above it.
                    
    "level":int     Refers to the level of that variable in the grouping tree. A level 3
                    variable followed by level 4 rows would indicate the parent child
                    relationship until the next level 3 is encountered.
                    
    "title":str     Provides the description of the variable.

    "ucc":str       Provides the UCC or variable name.
    
    "survey":str    Sets the source survel that collected that variable:
                        I: Interview survey
                        D: Diary survey
                        G and T: Titles
                        S: Statistical UCCs

    "category":str  Defines the highest level category for each variable
                        CUCHARS: CU characteristics
                        FOOD: Food expenditures
                        EXPEND: Non-food expenditures
                        INCOME: Income types
                        ASSETS: Asset types
                        ADDENDA: Other financial information and gifts
